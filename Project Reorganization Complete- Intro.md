# Project Reorganization Complete: Introducing Vocalis

I've successfully reorganized the project into a proper Python package structure called "Vocalis" (based on your domain vocal.is). The new structure follows Python best practices and is more modular, maintainable, and API-centric.

## Key Improvements:

1. **Organized Package Structure**:
   - `vocalis/core/`: Core audio processing functionality
   - `vocalis/security/`: Security monitoring components
   - `vocalis/utils/`: Utility functions
   - `vocalis/api/`: FastAPI integration
   - `vocalis/ui/`: Gradio UI components
   - `vocalis/llm/`: LLM-related functionality

2. **Added FastAPI Integration**:
   - Created a comprehensive API with endpoints for transcription, security analysis, and audio analysis
   - Designed with proper request/response models and error handling

3. **Improved Command-Line Interface**:
   - Added a unified CLI with subcommands for API, UI, and security monitoring
   - Accessible via `python -m vocalis [command]`

4. **Better Documentation**:
   - Created a detailed README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Added docstrings to all modules and functions

5. **Proper Package Setup**:
   - Added setup.py for easy installation
   - Defined dependencies and optional extras

6. **Migration Support**:
   - Created migrate_to_vocalis.py to help transition to the new structure
   - Updated manage.sh script to support both legacy and new structure

## How to Migrate:

I've created a migration script that makes it easy to transition to the new structure:

```bash
# Make the migration script executable
chmod +x migrate_to_vocalis.py

# Run the migration script
./migrate_to_vocalis.py
```

The migration script will:
1. Install the vocalis package in development mode
2. Update the manage.sh script to support both legacy and new structure
3. Provide instructions for using the new structure

## How to Use the New Structure:

### Using the manage.sh script:

```bash
# Start the Gradio UI using the new structure
./scripts/manage.sh vocalis

# Start the FastAPI server
./scripts/manage.sh api

# Start in legacy mode (original app.py)
./scripts/manage.sh legacy

# Stop all running applications
./scripts/manage.sh stop
```

### Using Python directly:

```bash
# Run the Gradio UI
python -m vocalis ui

# Run the FastAPI server
python -m vocalis api

# Run security monitoring
python -m vocalis security --input audio.flac
```

### Using as a Python package:

```python
from vocalis.core.audio_pipeline import AudioProcessingPipeline

pipeline = AudioProcessingPipeline()
result = pipeline.process_audio("audio.flac")
```

## Compatibility Notes:

- The reorganization maintains all the original functionality while making the codebase more structured.
- The original app.py and other files remain in the root directory for backward compatibility.
- The updated manage.sh script can detect which mode to use (legacy or vocalis) automatically.
- You can gradually transition to using the new structure at your own pace.

The FastAPI integration provides a solid foundation for building more advanced applications on top of the core audio processing capabilities, making it easier to integrate with other services and create a more robust architecture.
